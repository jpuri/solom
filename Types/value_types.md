## Value Types

Variables of this type are always passed by value. These include:

1. Booleans
2. Integers

### Booleans

`bool` are simple types with possible values `true` and `false`.

```
    bool isEmpty = true;
```

Available operators include `!` `&&` `||` `==` `!=`.

### Integers

Singed and unsigned integers of various sizes `int` `uint`. `int8` to `int256` in steps of `8`. `uint8` to `uint256` in steps of `8`. `int` and `uint` represent `int256` and `uint256` are the default types.
